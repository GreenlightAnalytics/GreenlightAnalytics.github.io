			<h2 class="slogan">Understanding Audiences</h2>
			<p>Greenlight Analytics was founded in 2015 as a spin-off from the Babelsberg Film University KONRAD WOLF. Our team of 5 is dedicated to exploring the possibilities of using Data Science in the film industry for evaluation, marketing and production. Building on our scientific expertise and our own practical experience, we work closely with the industry...</p>
			<p>Together with cinema operators and distributors, we want to exploit the potential of systematic data evaluation as a means of decision-making and an instrument for their daily work. In November 2016, we were granted the EXIST scholarship program of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy to develop smart products for the industry.</p>
			<p>We love films and want to shape the film industry with our experience in the areas of film production and marketing as well as software development and data analytics. In a constantly changing world of media it is necessary to understand the viewer. We help you understand your audience.</p>
